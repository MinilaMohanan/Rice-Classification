# Rice-Classification
There are many types of rice found in India. We can classify the rice into different categories by uploading the image . Here iam consider three types of rice  that are , "Basmati" , "Arborio" , and "Ipsala" . 
Certainly! In order to classify different types of rice found in India, including "Basmati," "Arborio," and "Ipsala," I have employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to automatically learn and extract features from images. My model has been designed to take in an input image of a rice sample and then pass it through a series of convolutional and pooling layers. These layers enable the network to capture important visual patterns and textures present in the images. After the convolutional layers, the model includes fully connected layers that help in making the final classification decision.

To train your CNN model, you've gathered a dataset consisting of labeled images of the three rice types. This dataset was then split into training and validation sets, allowing your model to learn from the training data and evaluate its performance on unseen images using the validation set. During the training process, the model iteratively adjusts its internal parameters to minimize the classification error.

After sufficient training, your CNN model has learned to differentiate between "Basmati," "Arborio," and "Ipsala" rice types based on their distinct visual characteristics. This model can now accept an input image, process it through its layers, and provide a classification prediction as output. The use of TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework, has facilitated the implementation and training of this CNN model, enabling accurate and automated classification of the various rice types commonly found in India.
